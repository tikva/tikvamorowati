<b>// Who is Tikva *</b>
<br>
<br>
Hi.
<br>
<br>
My name is Tikva Morowati and I've got a lot of nicknames.
<br>
<br>
What I don't have is a mission statement, instead just a relentless focus on people and problem solving. I also have some good questions: How do we understand user needs, design better interaction, and create technology that's more relevant to users and the community? (Pssss, and if I don't know the answer, I know someone who does.)
<br>
<br>
Maybe I'm just lucky, but I've learned from some of the brightest minds in tech. I earned a Master's degree from NYU's Interactive Telecommunications Program (ITP), which a star professor refers to as a "Center for the Study of the Recently Possible." My thesis project, Interventions for the Overly Connected, explores the hyper-connected lives of social connectors like Danah Boyd, Cory Doctorow, Clay Shirky, and Ethan Zuckerman. My research findings offer insight into product strategy, design and user experience.
<br>
<br>
I'm a collaborator at heart. My projects are fun, have taken me around the world, and have been covered by both tech and non-tech media. I've presented at the O'Reilly Emerging Technology Conference and at Microsoft Research, and I've testified on data privacy to the Federal Trade Commission.
<br>
<br>
 
And all this hard work wouldn't be worth it without the community. I'm most actively involved in Web 2.0 Expo Open Committee, nextNY, and I curate and coordinate Ignite NYC on behalf of O'Reilly Media and the tech community.
<br>
<br>
Ok, another coffee and back to work!
